Please install the correct Python module for the code to work correctly



Google Maps API is used in the website to display the map.
chat GPT was used to debug and enhance code.
The logo was designed by logodesign.ai
Github copilot was used to debug and enhance code.

How the website works:
The website is stored on a local server using python flask which is  to link all the files together when using the application. The programming languages for the front end are primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The programming languages used in the backend were Python (flask) and Javascript.

Procedure: 
The website is loaded onto the server
The user info is gathered and an account is created for them
The user logs into their account
The user now has access to the map and can report a crime.
Crimes reported are given a description containing the type, location, and details of the crime which is stored and can be accessed via the marker on the map.
The reported crimes are shown on the map as red pings and the user can access the details of each report by clicking the marker.

Thanks.:)
